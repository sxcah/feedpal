Variations and Considerations:

Contrast: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability. Use tools like a contrast checker to verify WCAG compliance.
Subtle Gradients: For card backgrounds or containers, consider very subtle linear gradients to add depth and visual interest without being distracting.
Saturation: Keep the saturation of accent colors relatively low to avoid eye strain in a dark environment.
User Preferences: If possible, allow users to customize the color palette to their liking.
